## Description

This is a portfolio website I am creating using the MERN stack (Focusing on how to connect React and Node). It is a 
4-page website with an About section, Portfolio sections (For Music and Programming), and a contact form using node
to recieve responses.

- To understanding things in the React Framework (Framer Motion, React Router, Styled Components, NodeMailer, ect.)
- To improve my understanding of Fullstack development with a concentration on Frontend
- To create a more attractive and dynamic portfolio website
